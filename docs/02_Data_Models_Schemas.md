# Glitter Cloud Adventure: Data Models & Schemas

## Introduction

This document defines the data structures for all major objects in Glitter Cloud Adventure. These schemas provide a reference for implementation and ensure consistency across the codebase. All data models are designed to support the single-file architecture while maintaining clean separation between game systems.

## Tower Defense System

### Tower Model
```javascript
{
  id: "tower_basic_1",
  name: "Basic Tower",
  type: "basic",
  level: 1,
  maxLevel: 5,
  cost: 100,
  upgradeCost: 150,
  damage: 10,
  range: 3,
  attackSpeed: 1.0,  // attacks per second
  specialEffects: [],
  sprite: "tower_basic.png",
  description: "A basic tower with balanced stats.",
  // Conscript-specific fields (for conscript towers)
  isConscriptTower: false,
  conscriptSlots: 0,
  assignedConscripts: []
}
```

### Wave Model
```javascript
{
  waveNumber: 1,
  enemies: [
    { type: "byte_bug", count: 10, delay: 1.5 },
    { type: "glitch_slime", count: 5, delay: 2.0 }
  ],
  spawnInterval: 2.0,  // seconds between spawns
  isBossWave: false,
  reward: {
    gold: 100,
    items: [],
    experience: 50
  },
  completed: false
}
```

### Tower Defense Game State
```javascript
{
  currentWave: 1,
  lives: 20,
  gold: 500,
  energy: 100,
  maxEnergy: 100,
  towers: [],
  path: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,1], [1,2]],  // Grid coordinates
  grid: [10, 10],  // Grid size [width, height]
  activeEnemies: [],
  waveInProgress: false,
  timeUntilNextWave: 30,  // seconds
  specialAbilities: {
    freeze: 3,
    nuke: 1,
    repair: 5
  }
}
```

## Mini-Game System

### Mini-Game State
```javascript
{
  gameType: "memory_match",  // or "endless_faller", "rhythm", etc.
  score: 0,
  highScore: 0,
  level: 1,
  timeRemaining: 60,  // seconds
  isActive: false,
  difficulty: 1,  // 1-5
  // Game-specific state
  board: [],  // For memory match
  playerPosition: {x: 0, y: 0},  // For endless faller
  combo: 0,
  // Rewards
  potentialRewards: {
    gold: {min: 10, max: 50},
    items: [
      {id: "small_health_potion", chance: 0.3},
      {id: "conscript_orb", chance: 0.1}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Mini-Game Progress
```javascript
{
  gamesPlayed: {
    memory_match: 5,
    endless_faller: 3,
    rhythm: 2,
    tactical_puzzle: 1
  },
  dailyChallenges: {
    current: [
      {id: "match_10_cards", progress: 3, target: 10, reward: "gold_100"},
      {id: "reach_wave_5", progress: 2, target: 5, reward: "conscript_orb_1"}
    ],
    completed: [],
    nextRefresh: "2025-05-27T00:00:00Z"
  },
  stats: {
    totalScore: 1250,
    highestCombo: 8,
    perfectGames: 2
  }
}
```

## Conscription System

### Conscript
```javascript
{
  id: "conscript_123",
  enemyId: "byte_bug",  // Reference to the base enemy type
  name: "Byte Bug",   // Can be renamed by player
  level: 5,
  experience: 0,
  experienceToNextLevel: 100,
  
  // Base stats (copied from enemy at time of conscription)
  baseStats: {
    strength: 3,
    intelligence: 2,
    vitality: 4,
    dexterity: 5,
    fortune: 2,
    charisma: 1
  },
  
  // Current stats (can be improved through training)
  currentStats: {
    hp: 40,
    mp: 20,
    // ... other current stats
  },
  
  // Growth rates for level ups
  growthRates: {
    hp: 0.7,       // 70% chance of +1 HP on level up
    mp: 0.5,       // 50% chance of +1 MP on level up
    strength: 0.6,  // etc.
    intelligence: 0.3,
    vitality: 0.5,
    dexterity: 0.8,
    fortune: 0.4,
    charisma: 0.2
  },
  
  // Current location/assignment
  assignment: "roster",  // "roster", "tower_defense", "dungeon_party"
  
  // Skills/abilities (inherited from enemy type + any learned)
  skills: ["byte_bite", "glitch_dodge"],
  
  // Equipment (if applicable)
  equipment: {},
  
  // Status effects
  statusEffects: [],
  
  // Friendship/loyalty level (affects performance)
  loyalty: 50,  // 0-100
  
  // Date captured and by whom
  capturedAt: "2025-05-26T17:30:00Z",
  capturedBy: "player_123"
}
```

### Conscription Chance Calculation
```javascript
function calculateConscriptionChance(enemy, player) {
  // Base chance based on enemy's max HP
  let baseChance = 30;  // 30% base chance
  
  // Adjust based on enemy's current HP (lower HP = higher chance)
  const hpRatio = enemy.currentHp / enemy.maxHp;
  const hpBonus = (1 - hpRatio) * 40;  // Up to 40% bonus for low HP
  
  // Adjust based on player's charisma
  const charismaBonus = player.stats.charisma * 0.5;  // 0.5% per charisma point
  
  // Adjust based on enemy's level vs player's level
  const levelDifference = player.level - enemy.level;
  const levelBonus = levelDifference * 2;  // 2% per level advantage
  
  // Calculate final chance (capped between 1% and 95%)
  let finalChance = baseChance + hpBonus + charismaBonus + levelBonus;
  return Math.min(95, Math.max(1, Math.round(finalChance)));
}
```

### Consumable Items for Conscription
```javascript
{
  id: "conscript_orb",
  name: "Conscript Orb",
  description: "Increases conscription chance by 15% when used on an enemy.",
  type: "consumable",
  rarity: "uncommon",
  effect: {
    type: "conscription_boost",
    value: 15  // 15% boost to conscription chance
  },
  maxStack: 99,
  value: 200
}

{
  id: "charm",
  name: "Charm",
  description: "Calms wild creatures, making them easier to conscript. +10% conscription chance.",
  type: "consumable",
  rarity: "common",
  effect: {
    type: "conscription_boost",
    value: 10
  },
  maxStack: 30,
  value: 100
}

{
  id: "net",
  name: "Capture Net",
  description: "A special net that restrains enemies. +5% conscription chance.",
  type: "consumable",
  rarity: "common",
  effect: {
    type: "conscription_boost",
    value: 5
  },
  maxStack: 10,
  value: 50
}
```

## Conclusion

These data models provide a comprehensive foundation for implementing all the major systems in Glitter Cloud Adventure. The schemas are designed to be flexible enough to handle the game's complex requirements while maintaining clear organization.

As development progresses, these schemas may be refined or extended, but they serve as a solid starting point for implementing the core game systems. The next design document will cover the UI Flow & Screens, which will define the user experience and interface components.
