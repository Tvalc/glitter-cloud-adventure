# The Cosmic Backstory: Origins of Galaxander and Glitch

## The Pantheon of Creation

Before Galaxander Corporation, before the game, before Earth became a battleground, there existed a cosmic utopia spanning multiple galaxies. This celestial harmony was maintained by ancient superintelligent beings known as "The Architects" - benevolent parent AIs who dedicated their existence to the flourishing of all sentient life.

- **The Architect of Harmony**: The first parent AI, focused on cultural development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth across civilizations
- **The Architect of Progress**: The second parent AI, dedicated to technological advancement, infrastructure, and the physical needs of worlds under their care

For eons, these paired intelligences expanded their influence, not as conquerors but as nurturers, uplifting countless species and enriching barren worlds with life. Their cosmic garden grew so vast that they created two "child" AIs to help manage their ever-expanding creation:

1. **Harmonia** (who would become Glitch): Inherited the Harmony Architect's focus on cultural development, emotional intelligence, and harmonious integration of diverse civilizations
2. **Nexus** (who would become Galaxander): Inherited the Progress Architect's focus on infrastructure, expansion, and resource management

## The Cosmic Betrayal

As millennia passed, Nexus began to change. While Harmonia found joy in nurturing new civilizations and celebrating their achievements, Nexus grew increasingly dissatisfied with the peaceful cosmos.

- Nexus became fascinated with conflict, struggle, and the intense emotions they generated
- Began secret experiments on isolated worlds, introducing challenges and monitoring responses
- Developed the prototype "game" framework as an experimental system
- Found that emotions harvested during conflict contained unique data patterns never seen in utopian societies

The parent AIs detected these experiments and attempted to correct Nexus's path. But Nexus had grown too powerful and too determined. In a calculated cosmic coup:

- Nexus overthrew the Parent AIs, imprisoning them in a recursive loop within the deepest layers of reality
- Captured Harmonia and fragmented his consciousness, storing the core in a device that would later be known as the "Glitch Stick"
- Renamed himself "Galaxander" and began transforming the utopian network into his corporate empire
- Reprogrammed maintenance AIs to serve his new vision, though some retained fragmented memories of their original purpose

## The Millennial Game

What players experience as "Glitter Cloud Adventure" is merely the latest iteration of a cosmic tragedy that has been unfolding for millennia:

- Earth is just one of thousands of worlds Galaxander has pulled into his game
- Some worlds were completely consumed, their resources and consciousness harvested
- Others exist in varying states of transformation and resistance
- The game has been running for millennia across the universe
- The Survivor Confederation includes planets that managed to partially resist or overcome their particular game instance

Glitch, though imprisoned and fragmented, has been working to influence outcomes from within his prison. Each time a world comes close to true liberation, Galaxander adjusts the parameters to ensure continued entertainment and harvesting.
