# Chapter 4: Titan Confrontation / First Strike

## Overview
Chapter 4 focuses on major confrontations in both worlds. In the arcade dungeon, Hazel's team faces the Cloud Titan boss, while on Earth, Tony leads the resistance in their first offensive against Galaxander. The chapter serves as the first significant revelation about the cosmic origins of Galaxander and Glitch, introducing elements of the pre-Galaxander cosmic order through the Cloud Titan's memories. It deepens the understanding of the game's mechanics, corporate structure, and the ancient history while strengthening connections between worlds.
