# Glitter Cloud Adventure: Story Progression & Economy

## Introduction

This document outlines the interconnected progression systems and economic model that bridge the arcade dungeon (JRPG) and surface world (strategy) storylines in Glitter Cloud Adventure. These systems create meaningful interactions between the two gameplay modes, ensuring that progress in one world benefits the other.

## Dual Storyline Structure

### Narrative Framework

The game follows two parallel storylines that converge at key moments:

1. **Arcade Dungeon Storyline** - A classic JRPG journey through a digital world
   - Character-focused narrative with party members and personal growth
   - Linear progression through zones with increasing difficulty
   - Boss encounters that unlock new areas and abilities
   - Mystery of the digital world and its connection to reality

2. **Surface World Storyline** - A strategic resistance against the Galaxander corporation
   - Resource management and base building
   - Defending settlements against enemy waves
   - Research and development of new technologies
   - Political and economic machinations

### Storyline Interaction Points

The two storylines intersect at specific junctions:

## Economy and Resource Exchange

### Resource Types

#### Dungeon Resources

1. **Gold Coins** - Basic currency for purchasing items
2. **Experience Points** - Used for character leveling
3. **Data Fragments** - Used for unlocking digital abilities
4. **Glitch Particles** - Rare resource for special upgrades
5. **Digital Essence** - Used for enhancing relics

#### Surface Resources

1. **Gold** - Currency for purchasing items and upgrades
2. **Metal Scrap** - Used for building structures and equipment
3. **Electronic Components** - Used for research and advanced items
4. **Power Cells** - Energy resource for powering facilities
5. **Medicinal Herbs** - Used for healing items

### Resource Exchange System

Players can transfer resources between worlds through portals:

```
┌────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐
│                    │     │                    │     │                    │
│  Dungeon Resources │────►│  Exchange Portal   │────►│  Surface Resources │
│                    │     │                    │     │                    │
└────────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘
          ▲                                                      │
          │                                                      │
          │                                                      │
          └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Exchange Mechanics

1. **Transfer Time**
   - Resources take game time to transfer between worlds
   - Higher quantities take longer to transfer
   - Upgraded portals reduce transfer time

2. **Exchange Rates**
   - Each resource has a conversion ratio to other resources
   - Rates fluctuate based on story progress and world state
   - Special events can temporarily boost exchange rates

3. **Transfer Limits**
   - Daily caps on how much can be transferred
   - Portal upgrades increase transfer capacity
   - Special portal events remove limits temporarily

### Economy Balancing

The dual economy system is balanced through several mechanisms:

1. **Resource Scarcity**
   - Different resources are scarce in different worlds
   - Encourages strategic transfers and specialization
   - Certain resources are exclusive to one world

2. **Sink Mechanisms**
   - Consumable items drain resources regularly
   - Building maintenance requires ongoing investment
   - Repair costs after defeats or damage

3. **Inflation Control**
   - Higher tier areas/enemies provide better rewards but require better equipment
   - Premium resources have usage caps
   - Late-game upgrades require exponentially more resources

## Character Progression Across Worlds

### Cross-World Character Development

Characters can transition between worlds with different effects:

1. **Dungeon to Surface Transfer**
   - Character's combat stats influence production efficiency
   - Combat skills translate to specific surface world abilities
   - Character level determines leadership capacity

2. **Surface to Dungeon Transfer**
   - Surface skills provide passive bonuses in combat
   - Production specialization grants unique combat abilities
   - Resource management experience improves item efficiency

### Skill Translation Table

| Dungeon Skill Category | Surface World Benefit |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Physical Combat        | Defense/Patrol Efficiency |
| Magic Abilities        | Research Speed Bonus |
| Support/Healing        | Production Output Bonus |
| Stealth/Evasion        | Resource Gathering Bonus |
| Leadership             | Settlement Morale Bonus |

| Defense Tactics        | Combat Evasion Bonus |
| Production             | Enhanced Equipment Quality |

### Unified Experience System

While each world has its own progression mechanics, a unified system ensures balanced development:

```
┌────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐
│                    │     │                    │     │                    │
│  Dungeon XP/Levels │────►│  Character Core    │────►│  Surface Skills    │
│                    │     │                    │     │                    │
└────────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘
```


1. **Market Mechanics**
   - Set buy/sell orders for resources
   - Prices fluctuate based on supply/demand
   - Special events can crash or boom certain resources

2. **Market Upgrades**
   - Increase transaction volume
   - Reduce transaction fees
   - Enable automatic trading

## World State and Environmental Changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### Story Event System

Events are triggered based on conditions:

```javascript
{
  id: "first_portal_discovery",
  title: "Digital Gateway",
  triggerConditions: {
    dungeonProgress: {
      areasVisited: ["data_highway"],
      questsCompleted: ["find_connection_node"]
    },
    surfaceProgress: {
      buildingsConstructed: ["signal_array"],
      researchCompleted: ["digital_transmission"]
    }
  },
  actions: [
    { type: "unlockFeature", feature: "resource_exchange" },
    { type: "playScene", sceneId: "portal_activation" },
    { type: "giveReward", rewards: [
      { type: "item", itemId: "portal_key", count: 1 },
      { type: "resource", resourceId: "gold", amount: 500 }
    ]},
    { type: "updateWorldState", stateChanges: [
      { key: "portalsActive", value: true },
      { key: "galaxanderAlertLevel", change: "+1" }
    ]}
  ],
  subsequentEvents: ["portal_expansion", "corporate_response"]
}
```

### Resource Exchange Implementation

The resource exchange system tracks transfers:

```javascript
{
  activeTransfers: [
    {
      id: "transfer_123",
      fromWorld: "dungeon",
      toWorld: "surface",
      resources: [
        { type: "gold", amount: 1000 }
      ],
      startTime: 1620000000,
      completionTime: 1620003600,
      status: "in_progress"
    }
  ],
  exchangeRates: {

    "data_fragments_to_electronic_components": 1.5,
    "electronic_components_to_data_fragments": 0.6
    // Other exchange rates...
  },
  portalCapacity: {
    level: 2,
    maxDailyTransfers: 5,
    remainingToday: 3,
    transferSpeedMultiplier: 1.2,
    nextResetTime: 1620036000
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The dual storyline structure and economy system in Glitter Cloud Adventure creates a rich, interconnected gameplay experience. By ensuring that progress in either world benefits the other, players are encouraged to engage with both the JRPG dungeon exploration and the strategy surface gameplay.

The resource exchange, character progression, and relic systems serve as bridges between the two worlds, while the unified story progression ensures a coherent narrative experience. These systems create meaningful choices for players while maintaining balance and preventing either world from becoming obsolete as the game progresses.

The next design document will detail the Mini-Game Integration, explaining how these arcade-style challenges fit into the overall game structure and progression.
